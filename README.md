# ML-projects

implementing decision Tree, KNN, bayesian, artificial neural network from scratch and three SVMs on IRIS dataset

### Artificial neural network :
implementing from scratch
    1-activation functions
    2-layer implements
    3-backpropagation

model(dims=[number of each layer neurons from first to last])

### KNN
implementing from scratch
using 3 types of distances:
    1-euclidean
    2-manhattan
    3-cosine

### Decision Tree
using in https://github.com/Suji04/ML_from_Scratch/blob/master/decision%20tree%20classification.ipynb

### SVMs
implementing 3 types of SVM from sklearn library:
    1-linear
    2-polynomial
    3-RBF
and compare some of these accuracies

### bayes
implementing from scratch:
using gaussian naive bayesian
